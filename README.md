# AdvancedTaskManager
This is an old implementation of a windows Task Manager I created back in first year of college. I thought I'll keep it up for old time's sake!

It included features like graphs, process lists, etc. it was very early when windows Task Manager wasn't very advanced either. This project is deprecated honestly as it hasn't been updated for quite some time. But do take a look and feel free to do anything with it!
